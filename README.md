### Algorithms:
+ Deapth first search(DFS)
+ Breadth First search(BFS)
+ A* search

### made with pygame

### How To Use:
1. Run main.py file, make sure you have pygame installed.
2. Left click and move your mouse to make walls(red colored).
3. Right click to add starting cell and right click again to add ending cell.
4. Click on the algorithms available on the right side.
5. Press 'r' on keyboard to reset the grid/board anytime.
6. To change the speed of animation, you'll have to change x in clock.tick(x) part of 
the code. files named BFS, DFS, A* have this code line.
